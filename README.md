# PyQt6_python_task
AIM:
App consists of a canvas and two buttons.
First button: When clicked, a random geometric image from the open source repository (https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/tree/master/src/symbols/geometric) should be downloaded and rendered at any random location on the canvas. It should be selectable and movable. An image from that repository should keep on appearing whenever this button is clicked, without removing/overwriting the previous images (compulsory).
Second button: This button will be used for grouping multiple images as a single object. You need to select multiple images and click the button. Those images will move as a single object thereafter (compulsory).
The image size and color may be displayed whenever a new image is rendered on the canvas (optional).
The location, size and color of the selected image (object) may also be displayed (optional).
You are free to include various other features and buttons like changing the size and color of the image, connecting the centers of the images, etc. to make your application more attractive (optional).
#Note:
I have not implemented the details of button 2 and the url I used is that of a google website and not from github repository
